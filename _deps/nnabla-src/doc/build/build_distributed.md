# Build Python Package with distributed execution support

Currently, distributed execution is supported only with [CUDA extension](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-ext-cuda/).

See the manual for [CUDA distributed extension](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-ext-cuda/tree/master/doc/build/build_distributed.md).
